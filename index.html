        <h3>Handy tips on how to create accessible websites for everyone</h3>
        <p>Author: <a href="mailto:fathima1205@gmail.com">Fatima Zahra</a></p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
          accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
          designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
          and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
          different user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldn’t be too
          difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have collated an
          ‘easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check
          these criteria off the list!
        </p>
        <h2>Accessibility Checks:</h2>
        <h3>Heading elements & Page Titles:</h3>
        <p>
          HTML heading elements have been used to represent page structure,
          supporting assistive technologies that allow page navigation from
          heading to heading.
        </p>
        <h3>Re-size Text:</h3>
        <p>
          You can vary text size by using your browser's text resize settings
          (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom, page zoom (which
          also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring styling issues /
          text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
        </p>
        <h3>Alternative text for images:</h3>
        <p>All images have been given appropriate alternative text.</p>
        <h3>Link text:</h3>
        <p>
          All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of context, and
          hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text style from normal
          body text. If a link opens in a new browser page, it has been labelled
          as doing so.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript independence:</h3>
        <p>
          Where JavaScript or other scripts are used for navigation or
          functionality, an alternative mechanism has been put in place in case
          your browser does not support these scripts.
        </p>
        <h3>Colour contrast:</h3>
        <p>
          It has been checked for text and background colour combinations to
          ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have also ensured that
          information is not referenced by colour alone.
        </p>
        <h3>Style sheets:</h3>
        <p>
          If style sheets are not supported or are turned off, information on
          the site can still be accessed and read.
        </p>
        <h3>Forms:</h3>
        <p>
          Forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them using
          only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The form labels
          themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making it
          easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of
          the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works for
          everyone.
